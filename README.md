# kata-js-start
A repository to start from for javascript katas

Requirements:

* npm
* node

## Clone and work on branch

One posibility is to clone the repo and work on a branch. 

```bash
git clone <url>
git checkout -b <name of branch>
```

I would suggest to name the branch something like ```2019_10_11_numberToWordKata```

## Download as zip

Another possibility is to download this project as a zipfile, extract it in a directory with the name of the kata.

Don't forget to init the git repository:

```bash
git init
```

## Getting started

After you downloaded the project you should install the dependencies. This means at least do the following:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the tests, use the standard way of running tests in npm:

```bash
npm test
```

In case you took a copy of an existing project and it refuses to work, try this to reinstall all dependencies

```bash
npm clean-install
```
